### 📚 What I learned

Key take-aways from this Frontend Mentor challenge:

-  When you're learning new things, it's seldom pretty. Keep learning, leave your ego at the door, build some things and you'll be a better developer for it in the end.
-  <strong>This was my first completed project using Sass and I fully realize it's a jumbled mess!</strong> I'm ok with this at this point. I tried different concepts on this project as I was watching the first 30 minutes of the freecodecamp sponsored video course (see resources below), so that should explain the odd choices to anyone reviewing my code!
-  Sass is going to take some time to get comfortable with, but I do think it will be worth the effort.  Honestly, I've avoided it for a couple of years, but I've decided to give it a shot. (*See more info on this in the following section below.) 

### 🚀 Continued development

-  I will be continuing with the freecodecamp sponsored Sass video course mentioned in the resources below and plan to use what I learn in the coming Frontend Mentor projects as well as projects for the [freecodecamp.org Frontend Development Libraries Certification](https://freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/).

### 💰 Useful resources

- [Install Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) - If you're using Node.js, ``npm install -g sass``from the command line will get you where you're going, or visit this link for other options and info.
- [Sass Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide) -New to Sass like me? Don't miss this overview!
- [Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS With Superpowers](https://youtu.be/_a5j7KoflTs) - This 2-hour video course featured on freecodecamp.org's YouTube channel was a great help with setting up my scss file structure and getting rolling with adding Sass to my project. FYI...This project was completed with info from the first 30 minutes, but I will be continuing with the full course.
