# Frontend Mentor - Product Preview Card Component Solution

This is my solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## üìùImportant to Note

Currently, I do not have a Frontend Mentor Pro Account and was not able to download the Figma design files. 

Images shown below represent Figma design files I created from scratch using the JPG static design images provided by Frontend Mentor as a guide.

### üìö What I learned 

Key take-aways from this first Frontend Mentor challenge:
 - Cross-browser check!
 - Don't over-complicate your code.
 - I feel comfortable with HTML/CSS, but I also have a lot to learn!

### üöÄ Continued development 

A few areas I plan to continue working on in future Frontend Mentor projects:

- Cross-browser testing
- Deep dive into CSS
- Increase design and development workflow efficiency
- Seek out and offer project feedback
