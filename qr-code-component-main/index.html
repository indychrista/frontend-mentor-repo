<!-- Thanks for checking out my Frontend Mentor project.
  The design was provided, but the development was fueled by my
  brains & coffee. If you find my code helpful, I'd love to hear
  from you, and don't forget...a little acknowledgement is always
  a good thing and helpful feedback is always appreciated! -->
